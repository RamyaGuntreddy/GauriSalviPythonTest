A string of lowercase characters in range ascii[‘a’..’z’]. 
We want to reduce the string to its shortest length by doing a series of operations.
Complete the MaxReducedString function. It should return the super reduced string or Empty String if the final string is empty.

1.In each operation we select a pair of adjacent lowercase letters that match, and delete them.
2.the string aab could be shortened to b in one operation. 
3.Now we have to delete as many characters as possible using this method and print the resulting string. 
4.If the final string is empty, print Empty String

Solution

def maxReducedString(s):
    l = []
    for i in s:
        if l and i == l[-1]:
            l.pop()
        else:
            l.append(i)

    return ''.join(l)

maxReducedString('aaabccddd')

Output:
abd
